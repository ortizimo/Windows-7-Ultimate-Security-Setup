=============================================================================
Important Information:
=============================================================================
	1. All steps in this guide have been confirmed multiple times that will not cause any damage/corruption to data, but as always, this
	is not 100% guaranteed. So,	take all necessary steps to save all important data before attempting this or	any OS modifications. Don't forget to
	include any browser bookmark backups which almost everyone forgets to do.

	2. These modifications are set for a system that will no longer accept updates
	(patches). I cannot guarantee that the modifications will remain if you continue
	to receive updates.

	3. The modified settings in this guide are for a Desktop environment. If any
	functions are required by the user to perform work/school (video chat, smart card
	remote desktop functions, etc) modifications will need to be reset to their
	original settings or just don't disabled them at all.

	4. Please read each modification option carefully to understand what they do
	before you disable them. Always backup your current Windows to an external
	device and do a restore point before modifying Windows.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: 	Windows 10240 has way less Bloatware than higher versions but are more
	difficult to remove. Cortana cannot be removed in this version. This
	guide goes over Windows 10 (19041) which is easier to modify.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


=============================================================================
Tools Needed:
=============================================================================
		Glasswire 1.2 (FYI, the latest version is now fully paid)
		ApateDNS (FireEye, free)
		CCleaner 5.6.7
		Notepad++
		Wise Registry Cleaner 9.4.7.619

All tools are in my Google Drive...contact me for access.

=============================================================================
Level: Advanced
=============================================================================

*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*
Important! 	Create an Image Backup and a restore point before making any
		changes! Better yet...do all the changes in a VM for testing
		before doing them in your actual system.
*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*


=============================================================================
Step #1: Initial Setup
=============================================================================
This step is going to take a while to complete but necessary based on my
findings.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: 	If you don't have .NET 3.5 then install it now before you start this
		step.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	1. Download CCleaner 5.67 from a legitimate URL

	2. Download ApateDNS from FireEye (Use fake email if you have to)

	3. Download Notepad++

	4. Download Glasswire 1.2 (Only this version will work)

	5. Download Wise Registry Cleaner 9.4.7.619

	6. Disable the Internet connection:
		a. 	Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network Connections
			Right click on the NIC icon
			Select Disable
		b. Or remove the USB antenna
		c. Or remove the cat5 cable

	7. Run ApateDNS and use DNS 127.0.0.1 then click Start

	8. Install all software


=============================================================================
Step #2: Removing Bloatware
=============================================================================
Use CCleaner to remove Bloatware like MS Store, Cortana, Mail, Tips, Weather,
Messaging, Eclipse, XBOX, OneDrive, People, Remote, Maps, Mixed Reality, etc.
Depends on what you don't want to use.

Additionally, I've used CCleaner, but depending of the version, it calls out
to China as Glasswire may indicate. So block CCleaner from updating using
the Host file and ApateDNS, or Glasswire/Windows Firewall rules.


	10. Go to CCleaner Settings and Uncheck Smart Monitoring and Auto Updates

	11. Go to Windows\System32\drivers\etc\ and edit the Hosts file using
		Notepad+

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:	You will need to run as Administrator for the editing to work.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	12.







	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: 	May need to allow for hidden files and folders in:
		Control Panel > File Explorer Options > View Tab to get to the
		Host file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	15. In the Host file type:
			127.0.0.1		<ApateDNS_Finding>

	16. Leave it running for a while and maybe do it after a few reboots to
	capture everything

	17. If anything shows in Glasswire make sure you block it by selecting
	the Fire icon next to the alert

Once you are done editing the Host file and modifying the Firewall through
Glasswire, make sure you save a copy of the Host file and export the Firewall
settings and again them in a safe place.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: 	If you don't want to keep CCleaner then uninstall it when you're done
		...If you're going to keep it, secure it with the steps I've mentioned
		above but also disable the Autorun, Auto Update and Monitoring
		features in its Settings tab
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	13. Use CCleaner to uninstall all the Bloatware that you don't need

	14. Clean the registry with CCleaner or Wise Registry Cleaner but remember
	to block them using Glasswire and/or the Host file

*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*
Important: 	You cannot re-install them later so make an Image Backup and also
			a restore point
*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: 	You can also use the server Host file from www.someonewhocares.org
		It doesn't contain the entries we're going to find in here, but you
		will want to use it	to block all the extra privacy leaks that Windows
		10 has...you'll be amazed of all that leaks! Just add it below your
		own entries!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


=============================================================================
Step #2: Disabling Some Privacy Settings
=============================================================================
This is the easy part, so enjoy it while you can.

	1. In the Search Bar type and run: privacy settings

	2. Go through each selection and Disable (turn Off) what you don't want to
	run automatically

	3. Reboot


=============================================================================
Step #3: Disabling Some Services
=============================================================================
This step will take you a bit of time to complete. Again, go through each one
and Disable the Services you don't need.

Some Services I've disabled are: ActiveX, Smart Card, Geolocation, Windows
Updates, Fax, XBOX, Secondary Logon, Remote, Telephony, Bluetooth, Error
Reporting and *Windows Event Logon.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: 	*If you turn off Windows Event Logon it will also turn off Network List
		Services and Network Location Awareness which may disable the Search
		Bar in the taskbar and you wont be able to search for anything...but
		this issue depends on the Window 10 version
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	1. In the Search Bar type and run: Services

	2. Go through the list of Services and make sure you Disable them from the
	Drop-Down menu and also Stop the Service if its running

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: 	Some services cannot be stopped
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	3. Look for Services that are of Privacy concerns or just plain useless for
	a regular Desktop computer to have

	4. Reboot

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: 	I recommend taking screen captures using the Snipping Tool in Windows
		to save the original settings in case you need to revert to them
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


=============================================================================
Step #4: Modifying the Group Policy
=============================================================================
This step is going to be one that also takes a bit longer to complete. The
folder you need to pay attention to is:
		Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components

	1. In the Search Bar type and run: gpedit.msc

	2. Open:
			Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components

	3. Look for any Rule you may not need or is Privacy related

Some rules state Allow while others state Turn Off...read what they say then
make the necessary changes by double-clicking...most are just plain Disable

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: 	By default Rules will read (Not configured) which is the same to say the
		Rule is either On or Off depending of what the Rule states
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: 	If you see an icon of an arrow pointing down, it means that the Service
		was turned off. You don't need to do anything in Group Policy unless
		you want to. But since this is Paranoid mode...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


=============================================================================
Step #5: Final Notes
=============================================================================
	1. DO NOT UPGRADE Glasswire...doing so will disable the Firewall feature
	and you will have to pay for them on the new versions

	2. Using Glasswire stop call-outs

	3. Using the Firewall disable all weird programs and IPv6 connections

	4. Using Notepad++ modify the Host file as you find new call-outs

	5. Using Services stop any unnecessary services that leak Privacy data,
	and those you don't use on a Desktop setup (not laptop)








=============================================================================
Step #5: Modifying the Registry Keys
=============================================================================
This one will not take too long to do but will corrupt your operating system
if you don't know what you're doing. You can create a backup of your Registry
using CCleaner, but I recommend you take your sweet time and know what you're
deleting/modifying before you do so. An important hint is read what you searched
for and make sure you know/want to remove or modify.

	1. In the Search Bar type and run: regedit

	2. CTRL+F to find keys

	3. Type:
			telemetry

=============================================================================
Step #1a: Removing Bloatware (Windows 10 below 19041 version)
=============================================================================
You can use Windows10Debloater to turn off and remove Bloatware from Windows 10
but you need to know how to allow PowerShell to make changes and also
Windows10Debloater sometimes doesn't work as it should or will not remove files
and registry keys. Keep in mind that this script will NOT completly remove
Bloatware in Windows 10 19041. You can use *CClearner 5.71 to remove these programs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: 	Highly recommend you uncompress the file in the Desktop folder and move
		the files to the first folder in the extracted one. Steps shown here do
		not account for this.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: 	PowerShell has Linux-like functions and commands...you can use TAB to
		autofill commands, paths, etc. Also, PowerShell is NOT case sensitive.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	1. Search for and download ONLY from Github Windows10Debloater (webmastir version):
			Select Code button
			Download ZIP file

	2. Run PowerShell x86 in Administrative mode

	3. In the prompt type and run:
			set-executive-policy unrestricted -force

		*When asked select (A) option for All

	4. In the same PowerShell terminal, go to the location the Windows10Debloater
	file is (usually Downloads):
			cd c:\
			cd users\YOUR_USERNAME\downloads\Windows10Debloater-master\Windows10Debloater-master\

	5. Run the script or GUI version:
			.\Windows10Debloater.ps1
			.\Windows10DebloaterGUI.ps1

	6. Go through the instructions shown

	7. Reboot
